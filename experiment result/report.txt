1. When iteration = 15, testing close to optimized	// iteration_2.png. k = 100
2. When k = 50, user based neighbor optimized		// k_1.png, iteration = 15
3. When embedded dimension = 10, factor with y/without y is optimized	// ed_1.png
4. With k = 50, when iteration = 15, neighbor error optimized. and with c is better // neighbor.png
5. When iteration = 15, factor error optimized. and without y is better // factor.png. embedded dimension = 10
6. Comparison of four model	// iteration_e.png
7. Comparison of train and test	// train_test.png
8. item and user performance comparison in different data set
			min count u/i	total count u/i
   Original 		30+/50+		100/600
   User_oriented	75+/10+		184/331
   Item_oriented	25+/100+	1080/26
   each better on their own data set	// item_based.png; user_based.png
